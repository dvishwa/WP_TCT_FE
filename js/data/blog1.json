PBS’s “Downton Abbey’s” best seasons are certainly far behind it. Netflix’s “House of Cards” – meh. (“The Americans” is 10 times better than it. CBS’s “The Good Wife” this season was 20 times better.) AMC’s “Mad Men” – it’s hard to remember which season we’re talking about here (along with which Don Draper we’re talking about with the Jon Hamm nomination for best actor): Hershey-meltdown Don of season 6? Or subservient-employee Don of the first half of season 7? In any event, my choice was clear long ago: Since we’ve exhausted our supply of praise and accolades for AMC”s “Breaking Bad,” the time is now to acknowledge that the best show on TV is HBO’s “Game of Thrones.”","subtype":"paragraph","isHeader":false},{"type":"sanitized_html","content":"<strong>Sharp satire rules!</strong> For once, I find myself nodding in assent with the list for best comedy series, which made room for HBO’s “Silicon Valley” as well as Netflix’s “Orange Is the New Black,” HBO’s “Veep” and FX’s “Louie” – all of which practice smart, relevant satire that starts and finishes conversations.
